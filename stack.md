## üöÄ **Meaningful AI/Remote Sensing Techniques & Concepts**

### **1. Data Aggregation and Feature Extraction**

* **Building Footprints (Google Open Buildings, Microsoft Footprints)**:

  * These provide geospatial accuracy at building-level granularity for energy modeling.

* **Nighttime Lights (VIIRS)**:

  * A key indicator of electrification status; brighter lights suggest higher likelihood of electricity access.

* **Building Density Calculations**:

  * Urbanization indicator useful for demand modeling and infrastructure planning.

* **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) from Sentinel-2**:

  * Assists in refining demand predictions by correlating energy use with land use types.

* **Internet Connectivity (Ookla Speedtest)**:

  * Internet metrics provide indirect but powerful socioeconomic indicators, which correlate with electrification and energy demand.

* **High-Resolution Satellite Imagery**:

  * Adds detailed context to each building for more accurate modeling.

### **2. Key AI Models**
Our AI models estimate electricity access and forecast demand at the building level with high precision, using a probabilistic learning approach. By combining nighttime light intensity, high-resolution satellite imagery, building footprints, internet performance, and land use patterns, the system identifies underserved communities and quantifies energy needs. The models generate both access likelihood and monthly consumption estimates, enabling targeted, cost-effective electrification planning even in data-scarce environments.

Bayesian Neural Networks ‚Äì For generating probabilistic predictions and modeling uncertainty in energy access and demand.

Multimodal Data Fusion ‚Äì Combines diverse spatial, visual, and socioeconomic data sources into a unified learning model.

Remote Sensing Feature Extraction ‚Äì Uses satellite-derived metrics like nighttime brightness and land cover to infer energy indicators.

Probabilistic Demand Modeling ‚Äì Estimates electricity consumption with confidence intervals, especially useful in unmetered zones.

Geospatial Deep Learning ‚Äì Learns spatial patterns across settlement types using convolutional and graph-based architectures.

Noise-Tolerant Training on Sparse Ground Truth ‚Äì Leverages limited or imprecise metered data with robust, uncertainty-aware techniques.
